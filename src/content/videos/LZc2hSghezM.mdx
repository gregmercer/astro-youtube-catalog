  [NOTE: Apparently my point that Apollo is hard bound to React is wrong. I'll be looking into that.]

Let's use the Solid-JS framework to create a todo app using queries, mutations and subscriptions. Then, in a quick twist, we repurpose the todo app into a chat app.

Solid: https://www.solidjs.com/guide
URQL: https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/
