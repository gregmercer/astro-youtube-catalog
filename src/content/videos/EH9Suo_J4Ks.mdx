  Test Driven Development is a fantastic way to build code that you know is well tested and will work. I know I should code this way, but why don't I? Let's find out what Test Driven Development is, and see if you should give it a try as we apply it to basic JavaScript and TypeScript functions, custom React hooks and React components.
