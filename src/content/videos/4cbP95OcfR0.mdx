  We finish off our Pokemon search page using Fower and Custom Hooks, and more importantly invite you to be on the May 21st livestream by submitting your own project to jack on the Discord server or @jherr on Twitter!

Submissions must be "Safe for Work" and presentable to a livestream.
Submissions must be cloneable from github and be installable in two simple steps (i.e. `yarn` and then `yarn install`) and runnable in a single step (i.e. `yarn start`).
Submissions must be in NodeJS (i.e. no Python or PHP projects).
The host (Jack) reserves the right to deny the submission for any reason.
